A work with team is a work with knowledge

## Project Topic: Kultra Mega Stores Inventory

### Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), based in Lagos, is a major retailer and wholesaler of office supplies and furniture, serving individuals, small businesses, and large corporate clients. As KMS looks to strengthen its operations in Abuja, there is a growing need for data-driven insights to guide strategic decisions.

I have been engaged as a Business Intelligence Analyst to support this effort by analyzing historical order data for the Abuja division. The dataset, provided in Excel format, contains records from 2009 to 2012 and includes details such as order dates, customer types, products, sales, and regions.

Using SQL skills developed in the DSA Data Analysis class, I will explore the dataset to address two core business scenarios outlined in the project brief. The goal is to uncover sales patterns, customer trends, and performance metrics that can help KMS optimize its sales strategy, improve customer targeting, and identify growth opportunities in Abuja.

Key deliverables will include:

Data cleaning and transformation

SQL-based insights and queries

Clear visualizations and business recommendations

This project will equip KMS Abuja with actionable intelligence to make informed business decisions and improve operational performance.
